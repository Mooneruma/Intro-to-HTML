<h2>Our History </h2>
<p>
	City Gardens & Landscaping started business in 2005 by founder Mr. Joe
Boxelder. We started from humble beginnings, running two landscaping crews,
and operating a small retail nursery. As the City of Des Moines grew, so did we.
</p>

<h2>Our Staff</h2>
<p>
Over the years, City Gardens & Landscaping has tripled both in size, and in
products offered. We’ve been under the same name and ownership for over 10
years. City Gardens & Landscaping now employees 30-40 employees, and
carries the largest selection of plant materials in the area. We have strong ties to
the local community, and have decades of landscape history and community
service work here.
